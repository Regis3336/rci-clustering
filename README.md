# rci-clustering
RCI is a geometry-driven clustering method that detects structure using Morse profiles, local curvature, and a matrix-on-demand Laplacian. It runs with a single scale parameter, auto-adapts density and intrinsic dimension, and identifies clusters as regions where geometric structure resists morphological erasure.
